# Open Closed Principle

This means that software entities should be open for extension and closed for modification. An entity can allow its behaviour be extended without modifying its source code.
 
Once a module or component is developed and working as intended, it should be closed from direct modifications. Instead the system should be designed in a way that allows for easy extension or modification by adding new functionality without modifying existing code.
