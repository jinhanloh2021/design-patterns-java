# Dependency Inversion
1. High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle, you can achieve loose coupling between different components of your software system. This leads to better maintainability, flexibility, and easier testing.
